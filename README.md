# Music App

This project is a music application with a clean and responsive design built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and custom CSS. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the ZIP File**:
   - Click the "Code" button on the GitHub page and select "Download ZIP".
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory on your local machine.

2. **Prepare Your Songs**:
   - Create a folder named `songs` in the root directory of the extracted project.
   - Inside the `songs` folder, organize your songs into subfolders named `cs`, `ncs`, `nncs`, etc.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - The root directory should include:
     - `index.html` (your main HTML file)
     - `styles.css` (custom CSS file)
     - `tailwind.config.js` (Tailwind CSS configuration)
     - `songs/` (directory where you place your music files)

## Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. Ensure you test the application on different devices to verify the layout.

## Custom CSS

Custom styles can be added in the `styles.css` file. Tailwind CSS utility classes are used for most styling, and you can customize them further as needed.
